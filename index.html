    <h2>4. Data Storage and Security</h2>
    <p>
      All account and app data is stored securely using Supabase (PostgreSQL and authentication services).
      Supabase implements industry-standard encryption and security practices.
    </p>
    <p>
      Passwords are hashed and never accessible to Quak Fit. We take reasonable measures to protect your data,
      but no method of transmission or storage is completely secure, and we cannot guarantee absolute security.

  <section>
    <h2>5. Account Deletion</h2>
    <p>

      <li>Your user profile</li>
      <li>Your activity history</li>
      <li>Associated personalized data stored for your account</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Account deletion cannot be undone. Once your account is deleted, you will no longer be able to access your previous data.
